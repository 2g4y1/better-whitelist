## 📖 The Problem

On most whitelisted servers, players always have to contact an admin when they want to invite a friend. That's annoying and time-consuming.

## 💡 The Solution

BetterWhitelist gives trusted players the ability to independently add friends to the whitelist – with a single command!

---

## ✨ Features

- 🎫 **Simple Whitelist Management** - `/invite <player>` is all you need
- 🚫 **Auto-Kick on Removal** - Players are kicked when uninvited
- 📊 **Invite Tracking & Limits** - Track who invited whom, configurable max invites (default: 5)
- 📋 **Statistics & Management** - View invites, remaining slots, admin tools
- ⚡ **Mutual Boost System** - XP boost when mutually invited players are nearby
- 🔄 **Hot Reload** - Update config without restart
- 🔐 **Permission System** - Secure role-based access control
- 👥 **LuckPerms Integration** - Optional automatic group assignment
- 🌍 **Multilingual** - German and English support
- ⚙️ **High Performance** - Async operations, persistent JSON storage

max-invites: 5         # Max invites per player (admins unlimited)

luckperms:

# Mutual Boost System - XP bonus when invited friends play together
mutual-invite-boost:
  enabled: true
  xp-multiplier: 1.5   # 50% XP bonus

## 📊 Invite System

Players can invite up to 5 friends (configurable). Use `/invitelist` to see your invites and remaining slots. When you uninvite someone, the slot becomes available again. All invites are tracked with timestamps in `invites.json`.

**Admin Features:** View any player's invites, unlimited invites, see top inviters from console.

### ⚡ Mutual Boost System

When two players have invited each other (mutual invites) and are within range:
- 🎯 **XP Boost** - Configurable XP multiplier (default: 1.5x)
- 🤝 **XP Sharing** - Share part of your XP gains with your partner
- ✨ **Visual Effects** - Particle effects and actionbar notifications
- 🌍 **Per-Dimension Radius** - Different ranges for Overworld, Nether, and End
